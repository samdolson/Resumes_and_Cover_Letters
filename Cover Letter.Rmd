(list groups you worked with)
<p><br></p>
I’ve conducted research in several different fields(LONG DASH)
 economics, market research, a college alumni group, and forestry— using a variety of research methodologies. My math/logic skills include XXXX (programs/languages etc.) I enjoy devoting time to learning new programs and applications. (whatever your field terms are for R etc)
<p><br></p>
My goal is to utilize these skills/opportunities and build new ones, as a research assistant. To further my skills, I just recently went back to my Alma Mater, Reed College to audit two statistics courses. Statistics Practicum and XXXX coursework reinforced my desire to pursue a career path in research through a semester-long group research project focused on process.
