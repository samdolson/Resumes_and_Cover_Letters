* *Text:* N/A, No Documentation Available
* *Subject Matter:* Full course for one semester. This course will introduce students to the analytical approaches and tools of the economics discipline, and how these are used to examine current issues and problems that arise in the functioning of economic systems. Microeconomic theories of consumption, production, and exchange provide much of the analytical framework that will be utilized, although we will also explore some relevant applications to the macroeconomy. A central feature of this course is the examination of markets and how they determine what is produced and how it is allocated. We also devote some attention to evaluating market outcomes, to thinking about remedies to resource allocation problems that markets cannot solve, and to thinking about the factors that determine long-run productive capacity and income potential. Lecture-conference.

The theory of international trade and the effects of trade policy tools are developed in both perfect and imperfect competition, with reference to the empirical evidence. This framework serves as a context for a discussion of several important issues: the effect of trade on income inequality, the relationship between trade and the environment, the importance of the World Trade Organization, strategic trade policy, the role of trade in developing countries, and the effects of free trade agreements. Prerequisite: Economics 201. Conference.

**Econ 392: Health In Poor Countries**

* *UW-Madison Equivalent:* ECON/POP HLTH 848 - HEALTH ECONOMICS
* *Instructor:* Prof. Nicholas Wilson
* *Grade:* A-
* *School:* Reed College
* *Text:* N/A, No Documentation Available (Assorted Academic Publications)
* *Subject Matter:* Full course for one semester. Poor health is one of the biggest problems facing poor people in poor countries. Diarrhea, HIV/AIDS, intestinal helminthes, iodine deficiency, malaria, sleeping sickness, tuberculosis, vitamin A deficiency, and yellow fever are common problems in much of the developing world. These health problems reduce happiness directly, as well as indirectly through decreased cognitive and physical ability in productive activities. This course uses microeconomic and econometric tools to examine the causes and consequences of a few of these sources of poor health. Unlike a medical or public health approach to these topics, we will focus on behavioral aspects of these problems. Some of the questions we will explore include: How responsive is demand for health inputs to changes in the price of health inputs? How does economic activity affect health behavior? How does information affect health behavior? Prerequisite: Economics 201. Conference.

**Econ 418: Behavioral Economics**

* *UW-Madison Equivalent:* ECON 455 - BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS
* *Instructor:* Prof. Jon Rork
* *Grade:* B+

* *Subject Matter:* Full course for one semester. This course will provide an introductory overview of the structure and operations of financial markets, basic theories of portfolio management, and how recent contributions from behavioral economics have improved our understanding of human decision-making within a social and highly interactive context. Students will learn about the basic functioning of financial markets in terms of trading, arbitraging, hedging, leveraging, etc.; their major products, like commodities, bonds, stock, options; and the basic theories of portfolio management and price formation. We will discuss how original theories have evolved to include contributions from behavioral economics about decision-making under risk and uncertainty, including behavioral biases. A discussion of price equilibria and the efficient market hypothesis will be combined with criticisms from behavioral finance on the existence of market bubbles and price anomalies, like the equity puzzle, herding, over-under reaction to new information, etc. The course will be mostly theoretical, but it will include occasional practical exercises in which students will gather actual financial data and perform simple corporate stock valuations. Prerequisite: Economics 201. Conference.
