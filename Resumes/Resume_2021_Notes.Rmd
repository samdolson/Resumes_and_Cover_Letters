: Tighten up margins (broadly, but also particularly on research experience/presentations section)

: Use consistent formatting (particularly use of italics, bold, etc.)

: (If possible) include statistics related to current and past work experience, e.g. 'Conducted 100 learning projects across departments at Fisher'

: (Maybe) adjust education to include recent online classes/future U of MN class

: Consider a different font family (currently Didot, may want to consider others)

: (When up and running) include link to personal website

: Check difference between Access & SQL (given it's a SQL-like db); also, consider adding 'Microsoft' before the products

: (When published, possibly prior-to) Adjust name of research from Summer 2020
