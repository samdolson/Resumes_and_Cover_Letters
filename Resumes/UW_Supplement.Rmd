<span style="font-family:Didot; font-size:1.5em;">  Educational and professional goals </span>
<br />

My goal is to serve as a researcher and a teacher. It is important to me that I am involved in research that connects people from disparate fields and teaching that inspires students to critically engage with data. I also want to inspire people to think about complex questions and devise ways to test those questions.  

Academically, I am interested in survey estimation and research methodology. My interests include interdisciplinary studies for teaching and research. In teaching statistics, I hope to raise awareness of the history underpinning statistical and mathematical studies, while inspiring and empowering students (and not just those studying statistics) to create, execute, and analyze research. 

As a graduate student at the University of Washington, I’m pursuing a PhD to become a professor. I hope to teach probability and statistics, methodological studies, and the history of statistics. I would work tirelessly to improve the communities I’d be involved in through teaching, research, and service. I am committed to pursuing a career in statistics as a researcher, but I hope more than anything to be an educator, to continue applying my skills to inspire others to learn and use statistics.
