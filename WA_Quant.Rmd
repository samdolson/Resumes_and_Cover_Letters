I have been doing quantitative work of some kind for the majority of my life. I am so curious about what constitutes life. The intersection between biology and statistics intrigues me, and I want to pour myself into it. 

I have been using HTML and RMarkdown to compile most of the materials the reader has read, or may read soon--if at all. I have numerous skills I'd rather not detail. Instead, I want to emphasize my two greatest skills: I am curious. I am devoted to learning. 

<!-- I didn't know until quite recently that I wanted to wholesale commit to pursuing a PhD. I did what I love doing: Collecting data. I went back to Reed College to take two courses I always wished I took in my initial undergraduate studies. Though I managed to get a summer research internship with the lovely Prof. Jeff Parker, summers were typically spent canoeing in Northern Minnesota and then trying to make rent with landscaping back in Portland.  -->

I didn't know until quite recently that I wanted to wholesale commit to pursuing a PhD. I did what I love doing: Collecting data. I went back to Reed College to take two courses I always wished I took in my initial undergraduate studies. The experience was incredible and transformative. The challenge brought about by COVID-19 to online learning has been consequential to teachers. 

I understand what it means to be a researcher, the commitment of time and so many other unquantifiable things. I'm going to give it everything I have. I want that experience to be at QERM.
